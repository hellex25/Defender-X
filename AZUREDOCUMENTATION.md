## Integration with Azure Cloud Services
DefenderX utilizes Azure cloud services for reliable and scalable infrastructure. Azure provides a wide range of services to support the application's hosting, storage, and other cloud-based requirements.

## Hosting on Azure App Service
DefenderX is hosted on Azure App Service, which provides a scalable and managed platform for hosting web applications. Azure App Service ensures high availability, automatic scaling, and easy deployment of the DefenderX application.

## Storage on Azure Blob Storage
DefenderX utilizes Azure Blob Storage for storing files and other data. Azure Blob Storage offers secure and scalable object storage, allowing DefenderX to handle large volumes of data effectively.

## Other Azure Services
In addition to hosting and storage, DefenderX can leverage other Azure services, such as Azure Functions for serverless computing, Azure SQL Database for data management, and Azure Security Center for advanced threat protection and monitoring.

## Security and Compliance
Azure provides robust security and compliance measures to protect data and ensure regulatory compliance. DefenderX benefits from Azure's built-in security features, including encryption at rest and in transit, identity and access management, and continuous threat monitoring.
